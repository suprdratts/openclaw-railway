#       TOOLS.md   — tool reference, tier-injected
#       PROGRESSION.md — upgrade guidance
#     These are force-restored every startup to undo tampering. The agent
#     can read them but cannot overwrite them.
#
#     SEED-ONLY (copy if missing, openclaw-owned, agent can edit):
#       PROJECTS.md — project ideas, not security-critical
#     Handled by the seed-if-missing loop above (step 2). Not in
#     PROTECTED_TEMPLATES, so the agent can customize it.
#
#     AGENT-OWNED (seed if missing, never overwrite):
#       IDENTITY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md, HEARTBEAT.md, BOOTSTRAP.md
#     Also handled by the seed-if-missing loop. These are the agent's
#     personalization files — they survive redeploys on the volume.
