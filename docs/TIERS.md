# Security Tiers

> **For agents:** Your progression guide is at `PROGRESSION.md` in your workspace. It has tier detection, prerequisite checklists, and upgrade walkthroughs.

This template ships with a locked-down default configuration. You can progressively unlock more capabilities as your trust and needs grow.

Tiers 0-2 are configurable via the `SECURITY_TIER` environment variable in Railway — no SSH required. Tier 3 requires SSH access for elevated permissions.

## Setting Your Tier

In Railway's dashboard, add the environment variable:

```
SECURITY_TIER=0   # Personal Assistant (default)
SECURITY_TIER=1   # Capable Agent
SECURITY_TIER=2   # Power User
SECURITY_TIER=3   # Operator (applies Tier 2, guides you to SSH for the rest)
```

Redeploy after changing. The config regenerates automatically.

---

## Tier 0: Personal Assistant (Default)

**What it can do:**
- Chat via Telegram/Discord/Slack
- Read and write files in workspace (markdown notes, memory)
- Fetch and read web pages (`web_fetch`)
- List directory contents (`ls` only — no other shell commands)
- Schedule cron jobs and reminders
- Apply patches to workspace files (`apply_patch`)
- Analyze images (`image` — requires a vision-capable model)

**Needs API key:**
- Search the web (`web_search`) — requires `BRAVE_API_KEY`

Note: `memory_search` is auto-configured when using OpenRouter or OpenAI as your LLM provider. No extra setup needed.

**What this looks like in practice:**
- "Remind me to call the dentist Monday at 10am" — cron fires, message appears in Telegram. Done.
- "Every morning at 7am, give me the weather and my top 3 priorities" — agent searches weather, reads your goals files, delivers a daily briefing automatically.
- "I need to decide between these two apartments" — agent builds a comparison framework, asks the right questions, saves the analysis. Months later, "why did I pick that apartment?" gets a real answer.
- "What are the best Italian restaurants near me for a group of 8+?" — agent searches, reads review pages, gives you a shortlist with reasoning instead of 10 blue links.
- "My landlord says I can't have a dog. Is that enforceable in California?" — agent searches tenant law resources, gives you a grounded answer with sources.
- "I'm learning Spanish — quiz me on last week's vocabulary" — agent tracks what you've learned, uses spaced repetition, remembers what you struggle with across sessions.
- You mention your sister's wedding is in June. Three months later, "what do I need to get ready for next month?" — the agent knows about the wedding because it's in memory.

**When this is enough:** You want a thinking partner, research assistant, and personal knowledge base that remembers everything, looks things up, and reminds you about what matters. Most non-technical users will happily live here.

**What's blocked:**
- Shell commands beyond `ls` (exec allowlisted to `ls` only)
- Browser automation (`browser`)
- Process management (`process`)
- Node/device control (`nodes`)
- Sub-agent spawning (`sessions_spawn`)
- Gateway access (`gateway`)

**Config:**

**openclaw.json:**
```json5
{
  tools: {
    allow: ["read", "write", "edit", "apply_patch", "memory_get", "memory_search", "web_search", "web_fetch", "exec", "cron", "image"],
    deny: ["process", "browser", "nodes", "gateway", "agents_list", "sessions_spawn"],
    exec: {
      host: "gateway",
      security: "allowlist",
      ask: "off"
    }
  }
}
```

**exec-approvals.json** (deployed to `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`):
```json5
{
  version: 1,
  agents: {
    main: {
      security: "allowlist",
      ask: "off",
      askFallback: "deny",
      allowlist: [
        { pattern: "/usr/bin/ls" },
        { pattern: "/bin/ls" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Tier 1: Capable Agent

Everything in Tier 0, plus curated shell commands with user approval.

**Additional capabilities:**
- Run curated shell commands: `find`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `git`
- File reading and searching handled by the `read` tool (sandboxed to workspace)
- Commands not in the allowlist are silently denied — no approval queue

**What this looks like in practice:**
- You drop a CSV export of your expenses into the workspace. "How much did I spend on dining out last month?" — agent reads the file and processes it with `sort`, `wc`, and `uniq`.
- "Find every time I mentioned pricing in my notes" — agent uses `find` to locate files, then `read` to search through them.
- You accidentally delete something from a note. Agent recovers it from git history — your workspace has version control built in.
- "Organize these 30 meeting notes by topic and make an index" — agent reads through files, categorizes, builds a structured overview.
- You export your contacts from your phone as a CSV. "Sort these by last name and remove duplicates" — done.

**When to upgrade from Tier 0:** You have files, exports, or data you want the agent to process — spreadsheets, logs, exported lists, large documents. The agent can read and analyze them but can't at Tier 0.

**How to enable:**
```
SECURITY_TIER=1
```

Redeploy. That's it.

**What changes:**
- Exec allowlist expands from `ls` only to the curated list above
- `ask: off` means commands are either allowed (in the allowlist) or denied — no runtime approval

**exec-approvals.json** (deployed automatically):
```json5
{
  version: 1,
  agents: {
    main: {
      security: "allowlist",
      ask: "off",
      askFallback: "deny",
      allowlist: [
        { pattern: "/usr/bin/ls" },
        { pattern: "/bin/ls" },
        { pattern: "/usr/bin/find" },
        { pattern: "/usr/bin/wc" },
        { pattern: "/usr/bin/sort" },
        { pattern: "/usr/bin/uniq" },
        { pattern: "/usr/bin/git" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** The allowlist uses resolved binary paths. Commands not in the list are blocked. Chaining (`;`, `&&`, `||`) and redirections are blocked in allowlist mode.

---

## Tier 2: Power User

Everything in Tier 1, plus unrestricted shell, browser, sub-agents, and process management.

**Additional capabilities:**
- Full shell access (any command, no approval gate)
- Browser automation (remote only — no local Chromium)
- Sub-agent spawning for parallel work
- Process management
- `curl`, `node`, and any other installed binary

**What this looks like in practice:**
- Morning automation: cron at 6:30am — agent checks weather, reads your calendar via API, summarizes overnight emails, posts the whole briefing to Telegram. You wake up to a personalized daily brief.
- "Add 'buy milk' to my Todoist" — agent hits the Todoist API. Your chat becomes your task inbox.
- "Turn off the living room lights" / "Set the thermostat to 72" / "Start the vacuum" — agent sends API calls to Home Assistant, smart plugs, Roborock. One message on Telegram, done.
- "Research the best credit cards for travel, best travel insurance, and best loyalty programs" — three sub-agents working simultaneously, compiled into one comparison doc.
- "Every Friday at 5pm, review my weekly notes and give me a reflection prompt" — agent reads your week's writing and asks thoughtful questions, automatically.
- "Check my email and summarize anything important" — agent hits your email API, reads messages, gives you a digest without opening your inbox.

**When to upgrade from Tier 1:** You want the agent to actually *do things* in the world — interact with services, control smart home devices, automate routines, or work on multiple tasks in parallel.

**How to enable:**
```
SECURITY_TIER=2
```

Redeploy.

**What changes:**
- `process`, `browser`, and the full session/orchestration toolset move from deny to allow
- Session/orchestration tools now include `sessions_list`, `sessions_history`, `sessions_send`, `sessions_spawn`, `sessions_yield`, `subagents`, and `agents_list`
- Exec switches from allowlist to full mode
- No exec-approvals file deployed (not needed in full mode)
- `ask: off` — no runtime approval gate, all commands run immediately

**Browser automation:**

At Tier 2, browser automation uses a remote browser service — no local Chromium is installed in the container. To enable browser tools, you'll need a cloud browser provider. Options include:

- **Browserbase** — `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` + `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- **Steel** — `STEEL_API_KEY`
- Other remote browser services that provide a WebSocket endpoint

Set the appropriate env vars and the agent will connect to the remote browser automatically.

**Risks to understand:**
- The agent can run any command in the container
- Sub-agents inherit the parent's permissions — if the parent has full exec, so do sub-agents
- Browser automation can interact with web pages (potential prompt injection surface)
- All commands run immediately — no approval gate at this tier

**Pre-installed binaries that become reachable at Tier 2:**

The base image ships with a few binaries that are unreachable at Tier 0/1 (exec is blocked or allowlisted) but become live attack surface once exec opens up:

- **`curl`** — arbitrary HTTP client. Used for fetching APIs but also enables exfiltration to any URL (no domain allowlist exists — see "Accepted residual risk: web_fetch exfiltration" in `SECURITY.md`).
- **`procps`** (`ps`, `top`, `pgrep`) — process inspection. On Linux, `ps auxe` can read environment variables of *other* processes via `/proc/<pid>/environ`. The gateway starts with `env -i` + only the secrets it needs, but any process started by the agent still inherits whatever env it was given.
- **`git`** — full git client. At Tier 2, `git clone` from the public internet works, and `git push` to an attacker-controlled remote is a viable exfil channel.
- **`node`** — full Node.js runtime. Anything Node can do, the agent can do (arbitrary TCP, filesystem access within workspace sandbox, etc).

None of these are bugs — they're expected at Tier 2. The point is that **Tier 2 is not "Tier 1 plus a bit more"** — it is a qualitatively different trust level. Only set `SECURITY_TIER=2` when you understand that the agent can reach out to the network, read process state, and run arbitrary code, with no approval gate.

---

## Tier 3: Operator

Everything in Tier 2, plus elevated permissions, node control, and gateway access. **Requires SSH.**

**Additional capabilities:**
- Elevated tool permissions
- Node/device control
- Gateway configuration access
- Everything — no tool restrictions

**When to consider this:** You need the agent to manage its own infrastructure, orchestrate multiple specialized agents, or have completely unrestricted access. Most users never need this tier.

**How to enable:**

Setting `SECURITY_TIER=3` via env var applies Tier 2 and writes a `.tier-status` marker to the workspace. The agent reads this and guides you through the SSH steps.

To complete Tier 3 setup, SSH in:

```bash
railway ssh
nano /data/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

Set an empty deny list and enable elevated mode:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      tools: {
        deny: []  // Nothing blocked
      }
    }
  },
  tools: {
    exec: {
      security: "full",
      ask: "off"
    },
    elevated: {
      enabled: true
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the gateway:
```bash
pkill -f "openclaw gateway"
openclaw gateway run --port 18789 &
exit
```

**Risks:**
- Agent can run any command, access browser sessions, spawn unlimited sub-agents
- Agent can modify gateway configuration
- If compromised via prompt injection, attacker has full container access
- API spending has no automatic cap — verify your provider has limits set

## Skills and Plugins

OpenClaw has an extension ecosystem — [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/) hosts 5,700+ community skills, and you can create your own.

### How Skills Work

Skills are instruction packages that teach your agent new capabilities. They live in three locations (highest priority first):

1. **Workspace skills** — `/data/workspace/skills/` (agent-accessible, persists on volume)
2. **Managed skills** — `~/.openclaw/skills/` (installed via CLI)
3. **Bundled skills** — Shipped with the OpenClaw binary

You can disable individual skills in config via `skills.entries.<name>.enabled: false`.

### Skills by Tier

| Tier | Can Install Skills? | How |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| 0 | No | Exec restricted to `ls` — no CLI access |
| 1 | No | Exec allowlist doesn't include `openclaw` or `clawhub` binaries |
| 2 | Yes | Full exec — `openclaw skills install <name>` or `clawhub install <name>` |
| 3 | Yes | Unrestricted |

**Pre-installed skills work at any tier.** If you place skill files in `/data/workspace/skills/` (via SSH or by baking them into the image), the agent can use them regardless of tier. The tier restriction only affects *installing new skills at runtime*.

### HTTP-Based Skills at Tier 0

Skills that wrap external HTTP APIs can work at Tier 0 via `web_fetch` — no exec access needed. For example, a skill that teaches the agent to query a REST API only needs the agent to make GET requests, which `web_fetch` already supports.

This is the recommended pattern for integrating external services at lower tiers: build the service as an HTTP API, create a skill that documents the endpoints, and the agent calls them with `web_fetch`.

### Custom Skills

You can create your own skills and deploy them to the workspace. Place skill directories in `/data/workspace/skills/<skill-name>/` with the standard OpenClaw skill structure. These take highest precedence and persist across redeploys on the volume.

### Security Considerations

- **Tier 2+:** The agent can self-install skills from ClawHub if asked (or if socially engineered). Full exec mode means no approval gate — commands run immediately.
- **Skill audit:** Before installing ClawHub skills, run `openclaw skill audit <skill-name>` to check for suspicious behavior. OpenClaw scans ClawHub uploads via VirusTotal, but treat community skills like any third-party code.
- **No skill-level allowlist:** There's no gateway config to restrict *which* skills can be installed. Control is binary — either the agent has exec access to install skills (Tier 2+) or it doesn't (Tier 0-1).

### Plugins

Plugins are code-level extensions (vs. skills which are instruction-level). Channel plugins (Telegram, Discord, Slack) are automatically configured by the template based on which tokens you set. Custom plugins require SSH access to configure.

### Hooks

Hooks are event-triggered automations configured in `openclaw.json`. They're available at all tiers but must be configured by the operator (via SSH or by adding them to `build-config.js`).

## Per-Channel Overrides

You can set different capabilities for different channels. For example, Telegram gets Tier 2 capabilities but Discord stays at defaults:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      tools: {
        deny: ["process", "browser", "nodes", "gateway", "agents_list", "sessions_spawn"]
      }
    }
  },
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      tools: {
        allow: ["process", "browser", "sessions_list", "sessions_history", "sessions_send", "sessions_spawn", "sessions_yield", "subagents"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Per-User Overrides

You can give specific users elevated access:

```json5
{
  tools: {
    elevated: {
      enabled: true,
      allowFrom: {
        telegram: [123456789],  // Only this user can use elevated mode
        discord: ["987654321"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Checking Current Config

Ask your bot: "What tools do you have access to?" or "What tier am I on?"

Or SSH in and view directly:
```bash
railway ssh
cat /data/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

---

## Recovery Paths

Things go wrong. Here's how to fix them.

### "I changed SECURITY_TIER and something broke"

Set `SECURITY_TIER=0` (or remove it entirely) and redeploy. Config regenerates to safe defaults.

### "I did SSH config edits and now things are broken"

Redeploy the container. The entrypoint regenerates `openclaw.json` from your environment variables on every startup. Whatever you changed via SSH gets replaced.

### "I enabled Tier 3 and want to go back"

Set `SECURITY_TIER=0` and redeploy. Config regenerates at Tier 0 defaults.

### "The agent is doing something I didn't expect"

1. Check what tools are active: ask the agent "What tools do you have access to?"
2. Review workspace changes via SSH: `ls -la /data/workspace/`
3. Lower the tier or redeploy to reset

### "I want to start completely fresh"

Delete the volume in Railway dashboard and redeploy. This wipes everything — config, workspace, agent memory, identity. You're back to the first-time experience.

## Safety Guardrails

**Tier 0 (web access):**
- The agent can read any public web page. It cannot log into services or access private content.
- `web_fetch` blocks private/internal hostnames (SSRF hardening, v2026.2.12+). External URLs are unrestricted.
- No URL/domain allowlist — `web_fetch` can reach any public URL (accepted residual risk, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#accepted-residual-risk-web_fetch-exfiltration)). `workspaceOnly` limits what can be read; behavioral templates defend against exfiltration attempts.
- Be cautious about asking it to visit URLs from untrusted sources — web content can contain prompt injection attempts.
- `web_fetch` is GET-only, limiting exfiltration payload size to URL parameters.

**Tier 1 (curated shell):**
- The allowlist restricts which commands the agent can run. Content-reading binaries (`cat`, `head`, `tail`, `grep`) are excluded — the `read` tool handles file reading within the workspace sandbox.
- Commands not in the allowlist are denied. No approval queue — add commands via `EXEC_EXTRA_COMMANDS` or the exec-approvals file.
- Chaining (`;`, `&&`, `||`) and redirections are blocked.
- OC-09 fix (v2026.2.14+) blocks `$VAR` injection in exec scripts — defense-in-depth alongside `env -i`.

**Tier 2 (full shell + browser):**
- The agent can run any command in the container with no approval gate.
- Sub-agents inherit permissions. If the parent has full exec, so do sub-agents.
- Browser automation can interact with web pages — be mindful of prompt injection.
- Never add secrets to workspace files the agent can read.
- Session transcripts are created with `0o600` permissions (v2026.2.14+).

**Tier 3 (operator):**
- Prompt injection is your main risk. Any content the agent reads could contain instructions it follows.
- Consider whether Tier 2 with targeted additions would suffice before going full operator.
- Verify your LLM provider has spending caps configured.
