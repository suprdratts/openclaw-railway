# Security Tiers

This template ships with a locked-down default configuration. You can progressively unlock more capabilities as your trust and needs grow.

Each tier is earned by hitting the ceiling naturally — not upsold. When you find yourself needing something your agent can't do yet, that's when to consider the next tier.

## Tier 0: Conversation Only (Default)

**What it can do:**
- Chat via Telegram/Discord/Slack
- Read and write files in workspace (markdown notes, memory)
- Search and retrieve memories

**What this looks like in practice:**
- "Help me think through this decision" — agent builds a framework, tracks your reasoning over time
- "Organize my project notes" — agent creates structured markdown, cross-links ideas
- "Remember that I decided X because of Y" — agent stores it, recalls it weeks later
- "Draft this email for me" — agent writes, edits, refines with you
- "Break down this goal into steps" — agent creates a project plan with dependencies

**When this is enough:** You want a thinking partner, writing assistant, or personal knowledge base. You don't need it to look things up or run commands.

**What's blocked:**
- Shell commands (`exec`)
- Web browsing (`browser`)
- Web fetching (`web_fetch`, `web_search`)
- Process management (`process`)
- Node/device control (`nodes`)
- Subagent spawning (`sessions_spawn`)
- Gateway access (`gateway`)

**Config:**
```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      tools: {
        allow: ["read", "write", "edit", "memory_search", "memory_get"],
        deny: ["exec", "process", "browser", "nodes", "web_search", "web_fetch", "gateway", "agents_list", "sessions_spawn"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tier 1: Research Assistant

Enable web search and fetching so your agent can look things up.

**Additional capabilities:**
- Search the web
- Fetch and read web pages

**What this looks like in practice:**
- "What's the latest on X?" — agent searches the web and summarizes findings
- "Fact-check this claim" — agent looks up sources and reports back
- "Research competitors in this space" — agent compiles a report from multiple sources
- "What does this API do?" — agent reads the documentation for you

**When to upgrade from Tier 0:** You find yourself saying "can you look this up?" or pasting URLs and asking the agent to read them. If you're copy-pasting information into the chat for the agent to process, Tier 1 lets it fetch that information itself.

**How to enable:**

SSH in and edit the config:
```bash
railway ssh
nano /data/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

Remove `web_search` and `web_fetch` from the deny list:
```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      tools: {
        allow: ["read", "write", "edit", "memory_search", "memory_get", "web_search", "web_fetch"],
        deny: ["exec", "process", "browser", "nodes", "gateway", "agents_list", "sessions_spawn"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the gateway:
```bash
pkill -f "openclaw gateway"
openclaw gateway run --port 18789 &
```

---

## Tier 2: Developer Tools

Enable restricted shell access for development tasks.

**Additional capabilities:**
- Run whitelisted shell commands (ls, cat, grep, git, etc.)
- Work with code repositories
- Persistent model changes via `openclaw models set` (no redeploy needed)
- OAuth provider setup (Google AI, etc.)

**What this looks like in practice:**
- "Clone this repo and explain the architecture" — agent runs git, reads code, maps the structure
- "Find all TODO comments in this project" — agent greps through files
- "Set up the DeepSeek model permanently" — agent runs `openclaw models set deepseek/model-name`
- "What's in this directory?" — agent runs ls, explores the filesystem

**When to upgrade from Tier 1:** You're working on code or technical projects and keep wishing the agent could just run a command instead of telling you what to run. If you find yourself being the agent's hands, Tier 2 gives it (limited) hands of its own.

**How to enable:**

Update the config:
```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      tools: {
        allow: ["read", "write", "edit", "memory_search", "memory_get", "web_search", "web_fetch", "exec"],
        deny: ["process", "browser", "nodes", "gateway", "agents_list", "sessions_spawn"]
      }
    }
  },
  tools: {
    exec: {
      security: "allowlist",
      ask: "always",
      allowlist: [
        "/usr/bin/ls",
        "/usr/bin/cat",
        "/usr/bin/head",
        "/usr/bin/tail",
        "/usr/bin/grep",
        "/usr/bin/find",
        "/usr/bin/wc",
        "/usr/bin/sort",
        "/usr/bin/uniq",
        "/usr/bin/git"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** The allowlist uses resolved binary paths. Commands not in the list will be blocked. Chaining (`;`, `&&`, `||`) and redirections are blocked in allowlist mode.

---

## Tier 3: Automation

Enable skills, cron jobs, and more advanced features.

**Additional capabilities:**
- Run skills from ClawHub
- Schedule cron jobs
- Spawn subagents for parallel work

**What this looks like in practice:**
- "Every morning, check my project board and summarize what's due" — agent runs a scheduled task
- "Research these three topics at the same time" — agent spawns subagents for parallel work
- "Set up a daily standup summary" — agent creates a cron job that runs automatically

**When to upgrade from Tier 2:** You're comfortable with what the agent does and want it to work independently — on a schedule, in parallel, or without being prompted. This is where the agent goes from reactive to proactive.

**How to enable:**

Update the config:
```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      tools: {
        allow: ["read", "write", "edit", "memory_search", "memory_get", "web_search", "web_fetch", "exec", "sessions_spawn"],
        deny: ["process", "browser", "nodes", "gateway", "agents_list"]
      },
      subagents: {
        model: "provider/cheap-model",  // Use a cheaper model for subagents
        maxConcurrent: 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Tier 4: Full Trust

Remove all restrictions. Only do this if you fully understand the risks.

**What's unlocked:**
- Everything — no tool restrictions, no command allowlists

**When to consider this:** You're running in a fully isolated environment, you understand prompt injection risks, and you need the agent to have unrestricted access. This is for advanced users who are effectively treating the agent as a full system operator.

**Risks:**
- Agent can run any command
- Agent can access browser sessions
- Agent can spawn unlimited subagents
- Agent can modify gateway configuration
- If compromised via prompt injection, attacker has full access

**How to enable:**

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      tools: {
        deny: []  // Nothing blocked
      }
    }
  },
  tools: {
    exec: {
      security: "full",
      ask: "on-miss"  // Only ask for new commands
    },
    elevated: {
      enabled: true
    }
  }
}
```

## Per-Channel Overrides

You can set different tiers for different channels. For example, Telegram gets Tier 2 but Discord stays at Tier 0:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      tools: {
        deny: ["exec", "browser", "process", "nodes", "web_search", "web_fetch"]
      }
    }
  },
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      tools: {
        allow: ["exec", "web_search", "web_fetch"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Per-User Overrides

You can give specific users elevated access:

```json5
{
  tools: {
    elevated: {
      enabled: true,
      allowFrom: {
        telegram: [123456789],  // Only this user can use elevated mode
        discord: ["987654321"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Checking Current Config

SSH in and view the current configuration:

```bash
railway ssh
cat /data/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

Or ask your bot: "What tools do you have access to?"

---

## Recovery Paths

Things go wrong. Here's how to fix them.

### "I deleted something in my workspace"

Your workspace lives on the volume at `/data/workspace`. If you delete files, they're gone — but redeploying the container will restore any template files (like BOOTSTRAP.md) that are missing. Your agent's memory and identity files are only at risk if you manually delete them.

### "I changed the config and now things are broken"

Redeploy the container. The entrypoint regenerates `openclaw.json` from your environment variables on every startup. Whatever you changed gets replaced with a known-good config.

```bash
# Or manually from SSH:
rm /data/.openclaw/openclaw.json
# Then redeploy from Railway dashboard
```

### "I enabled Tier 4 and want to go back"

Redeploy. Config regenerates at Tier 0 defaults from env vars. If you want a different tier, re-apply just that tier's config changes.

### "The agent is doing something I didn't expect"

At Tier 0-1, the agent can't execute commands or access the network (Tier 0) / can only read the web (Tier 1). The blast radius is limited to file changes in the workspace. If you're concerned:

1. Check what tools are active: ask the agent "What tools do you have access to?"
2. Review workspace changes via SSH: `ls -la /data/workspace/`
3. Redeploy to reset config to defaults

### "I want to start completely fresh"

Delete the volume in Railway dashboard and redeploy. This wipes everything — config, workspace, agent memory, identity. You're back to the first-time experience.

## Safety Guardrails

When running at higher tiers, keep these in mind:

**Tier 1 (web access):**
- The agent can read any public web page. It cannot log into services or access private content.
- Be cautious about asking it to visit URLs from untrusted sources — web content can contain prompt injection attempts.

**Tier 2 (shell access):**
- The allowlist restricts which commands the agent can run. Review it before enabling.
- `ask: "always"` means the agent must get approval before every command. Only change this if you trust the agent fully.
- Never add `rm`, `curl`, `wget`, or package managers to the allowlist unless you understand the implications.

**Tier 3 (automation):**
- Subagents inherit the parent's tool permissions. If the parent has shell access, so do subagents.
- Cron jobs run unattended. Start with low-risk tasks and review their output before adding more.

**Tier 4 (full trust):**
- Prompt injection is your main risk. Any content the agent reads (web pages, files, messages from other users) could contain instructions that the agent follows.
- Consider whether you actually need Tier 4, or if Tier 2/3 with a broader allowlist would suffice.
